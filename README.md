## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### File Loading Problems
- **Symptom**: File fails to load or shows an error message
  - ‚úÖ **Solution**: 
    - Ensure the file is not open in another program
    - Verify the file is not corrupted

    - Try saving the file in Excel as `.xlsx` format

#### Performance Issues with Large Files
- **Symptom**: Application is slow or becomes unresponsive
  - ‚úÖ **Solution**:
    - For files with >10,000 rows:
      - Close other applications to free up memory

      - Consider splitting large files into smaller chunks
      - Use the "View Raw Data" tab with pagination

#### No Duplicates Found
- **Symptom**: Application reports no duplicates when you expect some
  - ‚úÖ **Solution**:
    - Check for leading/trailing spaces in your data
    - Try selecting different columns for duplicate checking
    - Verify that the selected columns contain the expected data
    - Use the "Data Cleaning" tab to standardize your data first

#### Data Format Issues
- **Symptom**: Numbers or dates not being recognized correctly
  - ‚úÖ **Solution**:
    - Ensure consistent data types in each column
    - Format cells correctly in Excel before importing
    - Check for hidden characters or non-printable characters

  - ‚úÖ **Solution**:
    - Use the "Highlight blank/empty cells" feature in the Raw Data tab
    - Check for cells with only spaces or non-breaking spaces

    - Ensure you have write permissions in the download directory
    - Check if your antivirus is blocking the download
    - Try downloading with a different web browser

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check the Browser Console**
   - Press `F12` to open developer tools
   - Look for any error messages in the Console tab

2. **Verify Data Types**
   - Use the "Data Statistics" tab to check column data types
   - Look for mixed data types in the same column

3. **Test with Sample Data**
   - Generate and test with the sample data to verify if the issue is with your file
   ```bash
   python generate_sample_data.py
   ```

4. **Check Application Logs**
